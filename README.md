# App Of Our Own

App Of Our Own, or AppO3, is a modern Archive Of Our Own reader for Android.

It is heavy inspired by the now-archived Tachiyomi and its derivatives.

It has the following features:

- No login or signup required
- Dark mode, including pure-darks for OLED
- Save works
- Save progress read on works
- See updates to your saved works
- Backup & import data
- Customizeable reader, including user-addable fonts, user-customizeable colours, etc.
- Download works for offline reading
- Reading time stats

AppO3 is fully open source and privacy-respecting. No data is collected, we never ask for a login or signup, and never will.

AppO3 is currently in beta and is not entirely stable. Please report any bugs, and use it at your own risk. You have been warned.

(AppO3 is in no way affiliated with the developers of AO3. AppO3 is a standalone project.)
